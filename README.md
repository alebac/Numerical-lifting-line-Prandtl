# Numerical-lifting-line-Prandtl
This matlab program computes the aerodynamic properties of a wing of high aspect ratio considering also the effects of the propellers. It applies the Prandtl method including in the general equation the airflow acceleration due to the propeller. The equation is then solved using the classical  Fourier expansion method.
